Hi, I'm Michael, and welcome to my website! ðŸŽ‰

I'm a Software Engineer from Italy with a strong passion for **technology** and **innovation**. I love building new stuff, and I
spend a considerable amount of time learning new things both for my job, efficiency and / or sheer curiosity.

From a professional standpoint, I mostly work with **C#** and **TypeScript**. However, I fell in love with **Go**, and I always try to
find some time to write something in this awesome language.
My projects are mostly related to **Web Development**, as my job is; but I find myself messing around with [Creative Coding](https://processing.org/), Game Development and more!

### Why a personal website?

To start, I want to clearly state **this website is not supposed to work as my CV nor as a portfolio**. This is only **my little unprofessional space on the Internet**. 

I decided to build this website to have a space to freely write about pretty much anything. My first blog was all about tech and programming, I will now treat my website as **MY website** and write anything I feel like writing (not necessarily about tech). 

I might add that, although I'm quite the talkative one, I don't necessarily like being around people, and I love to be one my own with my toughts - writing is a good way to do that.

I had other two personal websites before this project. My main website, and a separate blog, both in [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). 
The code is still available here:

* https://github.com/armanimichael/armanimichael-main
* https://github.com/armanimichael/armanimichael-blog

If you want to know why they're no more and how I built this website, [you can read this](/posts/goodbye-gatsbyjs-welcome-hugo/).

### OpenSource

Since I don't have any interest in using this website professionally, you can find [this project](https://github.com/armanimichael/armanimichael-blog-go) OpenSource on my GitHub.

### No tracking!

Furthermore, since I value privacy, and I don't have any reason to know who ends up here, **this website is totally ads,
trackers and user-telemetry free!**
